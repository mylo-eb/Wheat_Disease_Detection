## Wheat Disease Detection
Wheat-based products are widely available across the globe. When we consider products like bread and other food items, we can observe that a significant portion of them contains wheat in some form. This highlights the extensive prevalence of wheat in our diet and daily consumption.

## Dataset Information
It contains 4 folders with the name of the folder being the class. In each folder, there are quite a large number of wheat images and their condition. The following are the 4 classes which we would consider.

- Leaf Rust
- Crown and Root Rot
- Healthy Wheat
- Wheat Loose Smut

## Cmputer Vision
Advancements in technology and increased availability of computational resources have made it more convenient to develop and implement deep learning models for tasks like computer vision. This technology can be utilized to detect different wheat diseases without the need for manual identification, saving significant time and effort for farmers and agricultural researchers.

## Outcomes
VGG19 was found to be the most effective computer vision model for identifying diseases in wheat plants. Its accuracy rate for identifying diseases in wheat plants was 95% when tested on data that the model hadn't encountered previously. Additionally, VGG19 was being utilized in real-time scenarios where users can upload pictures of wheat to determine if the plant in the images is healthy or infected with diseases.
Wheat crops are vulnerable to various diseases, such as Stripe Rust, which can significantly reduce their yield. Farmers face the challenge of identifying and preventing such diseases, which requires them to manually examine each crop and assess its health. This is a time-consuming task, given the large number of wheat crops in fields. To overcome this challenge, artificial intelligence and deep learning could be used to automate the process and provide a more efficient solution.

## Future Scope
Gathering and examining additional wheat plant images with greater accuracy is possible by taking into account various environmental conditions and lighting situations. Additionally, the technology could be combined with a camera to deliver frequent updates on the health of wheat plants.
